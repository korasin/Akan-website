Akan web project is on extracting
names basedon the gender, age, month
and year of birth. Akan is a small community 
Africa and they gove names according to
different time frames. This can help other
people to know their names.
The project uses the JavaScript language
to manipulte the formulation of the name
from the given information.
Html is used to give the detail of information
needed for one to get an Akan name extract.
CSS is used to gove styling of the page and get
it pleasing to the eye for clients easy browsing.
Bootsrap plays a key important role in making
styling of the pages easier by goving key components 
to the Cascading Style Sheet.
